video one -

tldr- incredibly detailed research and slide graphics but poor editing and presentation skills with the result of scaring you and giving you limited solutions or motivation

very detailed research with citations
for the most part very good graphics
especially regarding the ones that move (capture your attention)
very statistical
editing (making mistakes like stuttering and then taking long breaks before cutting the video)
first personal anecdote irrelevant
using vague statements, more examples would be helpful
they have most of the main points they are talking about on slides but don't reference them
could be useful to have less words on the slide so it's less distracting
moderate amounts of field specific jargon that isn't defined (intergovernmental, nonpartisan,positive feedback loops, jetstream, eutrophication, socioeconomic)
first slide of misinformation section was destructive but not helpful (that's a bad look), talks about all the bad things about fossil fuel companies and does not relate them to how it can help with climate advocacy
extraneous information on slides ("the problrem" slide does not need any words at all just the photos)
lacking introductions to slides (abrupt start to "extreme weather " slide)
stating an incredible amount of climate problems and not explaining how to fix anything
some unprofessional hand gesturing and vocabulary ("literally", you know")
